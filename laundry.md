Preface
-------

Prefer low-foam detergents for high-efficiency washers and front-loading tumblers.

The detergent amounts and temperatures bellow assume concentrated liquid detergents for home use
with enzymes (e.g. Tide Original HE, Seventh Generation, Omo Puro Cuidado).

Don't use fabric softeners.

Consult Swisstest's "Performance Overview of Soilings" for some idea of what washing parameters
certain soilings are generally most sensitive to.[^1]

Temperature
-----------

<= 20°C: delicate or temperature-sensitive items; note that enzymes lose effectiveness with lower
temperatures.

30°C: safe default for most items (synthetics, cottons, towels).

40°C: significantly funky or dirty items items that can take it (temperature-tolerant materials,
white or colors that wont bleed/fade).

>= 50°C: extremely funky or dirty items that can take high temperatures; note that enzymes lose
effectiveness with higher temperatures.

Soak & manually scrub
---------------------

Soak very funky, very dirty, and stained items for, preferably, 4 hours or more. Manually scrub hard
to remove stains.

Before the wash, run a quick spin-only cycle or, alternatively, enable pre-wash *without detergent.*

Optional: powdered pink or white Vanish to help with suitable stains or yellowed white items.

Manually treat stains
---------------------

In addition or as a replacement to soaking, directly apply some detergent and scrub with a small
brush (e.g. an old toothbrush).

Program selection
-----------------

For most items, choose according to the fabric: cottons, synthetics, or mixed.

Use delicate or hand hash for delicate or extra delicate items.

Pre wash
--------

For very funky or dirty items.

Detergent: 10 ml + 5 ml/kg.

Optional: powdered pink or white Vanish to help with suitable stains or yellowed white items.

Wash
----

Detergent: 10 ml + 10 ml/kg.

Reduce to 5 ml + 5 ml/kg in delicate or low-speed-spin cycles, because the rinsing will be less
effective.

Optional (only if not using pre-wash): powdered pink or white Vanish to help with suitable stains or
yellowed white items.

Avoid using the intensive mode, except when dealing with very resistant items or soilings that are
known to be very sensitive to agitation.[^1] Note that mechanical agitation may cause significantly
more wear that increasing the temperature, for sometimes a similar benefit in washing
performance.[^2][^3]

Extra rinse
-----------

Yes:

- on towels;
- on white items;
- on intimate items, or garments where left over detergent might cause rashes;
- when using pre wash;
- when using Vanish;
- when using delicate or low-speed-spin cycles (because of less effective rinsing);
- when, for any other reason, there's a lot of detergent.

Spinning
--------

Most items can take 1400 rpm. Use your judgment with delicate items.

At 1400 rpm, ensure towels are not stuck to the basket before drying starts. Alternatively, use
1200 rpm if drying will start without human intervention/supervision.

Reduce speeds during the night as needed for an acceptable noise level.
