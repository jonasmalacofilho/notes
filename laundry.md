Preface
-------

Prefer low-foam detergents for high-efficiency washers and front-loading tumblers.

Detergent amounts and temperatures bellow assume concentrated products for home use that contain
enzymes (e.g. Tide Liquid, Seventh Generation, Omo Puro Cuidado).

Check that the small text on the label matches the orders of magnitude listed
here, and/or do your own testing.

Don't use fabric softeners.

Temperature
-----------

<= 20째C: delicate or temperature-sensitive items; note that enzymes lose effectiveness with lower
temperatures.

30째C: default for most items (synthetics, cottons, towels).

40째C: very funky or dirty items items that can take it (temperature-tolerant materials, white or
colors that wont bleed/fade).

>= 50째C: extremely funky or dirty items that can take high temperatures; note that enzymes lose
effectiveness with higher temperatures.

Soak & manually scrub
---------------------

Soak very funky, very dirty, or stained items for, preferably, 4 hours or more. Use a generous
amount of detergent and/or powdered Vanish. Before the wash, run a quick spin-only cycle.
Alternatively, enable pre-wash *without detergent.*

Manually scrub hard to remove stains.

Pre wash
--------

For funky or very dirty items.

Detergent: 10 ml + 5 ml/kg.

Optional: powdered Vanish to help with suitable stains or yellowed white items.

Wash
----

Detergent: 10 ml + 10 ml/kg.

Reduce to 10 ml + 5 ml/kg in delicate or low-speed-spin cycles, because the rinsing will be less
effective.

Optional, *if not using pre-wash:* powdered Vanish to help with suitable stains or yellowed white
items.

Extra rinse
-----------

Yes:

- on towels;
- on exercise clothes; 
- on white items;
- on intimate items, or garments where left over detergent might cause rashes;
- when using upper end of detergent amount;
- when using pre wash;
- when using Vanish;
- when using delicate or low-speed-spin cycles (because of less effective rinsing).

TL; DR: usually yes.

Spinning
--------

Most items can take 1400 rpm. Use your judgment with delicate items.

At 1400 rpm, ensure towels are not stuck to the basket before drying starts. Alternatively, use
1200 rpm if drying will start without human intervention/supervision.

Reduce speeds during the night as needed for an acceptable noise level.
