Preface
-------

Prefer low-foam detergents on front-loading tumblers.

Detergent and fabric softner amounts bellow assume the fairly concentrated home
& low-volume professional products widely available in São Paulo &
Rio. They do *not* apply to highly concentrated formulations (e.g. some
refills, high-volume professional products).

Check that the small text on the label matches the orders of magnitude listed
here, and/or do your own testing.

Temperature
-----------

Cold: synthetic clothes; delicate items.

20°C–30°C: colorful cotton items.

40°C: colorful towels and sheets; white cotton items; cleaning rags.

≥ 40°C: white towels and white sheets; extra-dirty cleaning rags.

Pre-wash
--------

5 ml detergent / kg dry fabric on funky or very dirty clothes. Prefer a
pre-wash than adding extra detergent on the (main) wash.

Optionally: powdered Vanish to help with suitable stains or yellowed white
items.

Wash
----

5–15 ml detergent / kg dry fabric.

Optionally *if not using pre-wash:* powdered Vanish to help with suitable
stains or yellowed white items.

Stick to lower end if using pre-wash or Vanish.

Stay away from upper end on items that absorb too much detergent (e.g. towels)
or don't use softner (e.g. synthetics).

Fabric softner
--------------

As a starting point, 1/3 of the amount of wash detergent on cotton clothes.

Use less softner on items that must absorb lots of water and/or not get funky
when wet (e.g. towels, cotton exercise clothes).

No softner on synthetics.

Dilute the softner with water to the dispenser capacity (generally one lid or
~50 ml).

Less is better: if the items are not soft enough after the wash, consider
reducing the amount of detergent or adding an extra rinse, instead of just
using more softner.

Extra rinse
-----------

Yes:

- on towels;
- on exercise clothes; 
- on white items;
- on intimate items, or garments where left over detergent might cause rashes;
- when not using softner; 
- when using upper end of detergent amount;
- when using pre-wash;
- when using Vanish;
- when using delicate cycles (because of less effective rinses).

TL; DR: probably/usually yes.
